# isomorphic-react

# "node babeltest" will not run
# we must use "babel-node babeltest"


## webpack
# could not run webpack command to bundle at first
# had to specify where the config is:
#      webpack --config webpack.config.dev.babel.js
# run script now uses cross-env dep
#      cross-env NODE_ENV=development babel-node server
